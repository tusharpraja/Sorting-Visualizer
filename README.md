## ðŸ“Š Sorting.Visulizer

**_Sorting.Visualizer is a web app for visualizing a bunch of different sorting algorithms Like_**
1. Selection Sort.
2. Bubble Sort.
3. Insertion Sort

## âš™ How it works ?!
-------------------
**_Here in our model, each element value is represented by ```THE SIZE OF THE BAR``` and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right**

**_The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements, Without using any addational memory with creating another array.**
